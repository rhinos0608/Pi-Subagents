# Missions and schedules

Durable records for delegated work: missions wrap runs so you can recover them later, and schedules launch work on a timer.

## Missions

Missions are durable wrappers around runs. The noun map:

- **Project/codebase** — where work happens.
- **Mission** — why delegated work exists and how to recover it later.
- **Run** — one actual subagent execution.
- **Receipt** — proof or a link for an external outcome, such as a PR, CI check, deployment, or release.

Ordinary task launches create a mission by default, with detailed JSON records under `<cwd>/.pi-subagents/missions/` linking goals, run ids, lifecycle status, decisions, artifact paths, and delivery receipts.

Behavior:

- Automatic persistence failures do not block the run and are reported as `details.missionWarning`. Explicit `missionId` and `mission` requests remain strict before launch.
- Human receipts end with `Mission: <id> (<status>)`, while JSON/structured output text stays unchanged and `details.missionId` is authoritative.
- Pass `mission: false` for an intentionally ephemeral launch that should not leave a durable mission record.
- Set `missions.enabled: false` to disable automatic mission creation; explicit mission fields and actions still work.

```ts
const created = subagent({
  action: "mission.create",
  mission: { title: "Ship auth refresh", goal: "Implement and validate token refresh" }
})
subagent({
  workflowScript: `runs.run("main", { agent: "worker", task: "Implement the approved auth refresh plan" })`,
  missionId: "<mission-id>"
})

// Or create and attach in one launch
subagent({
  workflowScript: `runs.run("main", { agent: "worker", task: "Implement the approved plan" })`,
  mission: { title: "Ship auth refresh" }
})
```

### Managing missions

Use `mission.list`, `mission.show`, `mission.update`, `mission.attach-run`, and `mission.close`.

- Use `mission.update` to record decisions, artifacts, labels, summaries, and delivery receipts while work runs. Receipts are durable links for pull requests, CI, deployments, or releases, each with `kind`, `status`, `title`, `url`, and optional `description`. They record delivery state only; pi-subagents does not merge, poll CI, or deploy.
- Use `mission.close` with a terminal status and summary when a mission is done.
- After compaction or restart, resume from `mission.list`/`mission.show` first: `mission.show` refreshes linked async status where available, then use the linked run ids with normal `status`, `steer`, `resume`, or `stop` actions.
- `mission.list` with `missionScope: "global"` reads the user-local pointer index under the Pi agent directory. Project records remain the source of truth, and missing records are reported as stale rather than hiding other projects.

### Cross-project work

Keep same-project tasks on ordinary subagents. Use an explicit `cwd` for small bounded work in another project.

For substantial or long-running work in another project, open a project-owned Herdr pane with `project.open` and give that project Pi session a narrow mission/result contract (see [extension-api.md](extension-api.md#herdr-integration)). The project pane owns its own subagents; do not model it as ordinary child nesting or expect existing headless runs to move into the pane.

Mission storage configuration (`missions.directory`, `retainTerminal`, `globalIndex`) is in [configuration.md](configuration.md#missions).

## Schedules

Durable schedules are enabled by default and stored per project under `.pi-subagents/schedules/<id>/`.

Create a one-shot schedule:

```ts
subagent({
  action: "schedule.create",
  id: "evening-review",
  name: "Evening review",
  at: "+30m",
  workflowScript: `runs.run("main", { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review the current diff." })`
})
```

Create a fixed recurring workflow:

```ts
subagent({ action: "schedule.create", id: "backlog", every: "6h", catchUp: "latest", workflowScript: "..." })
```

Fixed intervals support `m`, `h`, `d`, and `w` units and advance from the planned time without completion drift.

Manage schedules with `schedule.list`, `schedule.show`, `schedule.history`, `schedule.pause`, `schedule.resume`, `schedule.run`, `schedule.run-due`, and `schedule.delete`.

Behavior:

- Runs always launch async with fresh context and disable automatic mission creation; mission attachment is deferred from this first slice.
- Definitions, bounded history, append-only events, and per-run receipts are stored with mode `0600`.
- `overlap` is currently fixed to `skip`; `catchUp` supports `latest` (default) and `none`.
- `schedule.run-due` lets an external launcher start due project work without making `pi-subagents` a daemon.
- Calendar recurrence, cron, queue/replace overlap, and the schedule TUI inspector are intentionally deferred to the next slice.
- The old `schedule`, `schedule-list`, `schedule-status`, and `schedule-cancel` actions were removed in a hard cutover.

Disable or bound schedules with the `scheduledRuns` config key in [configuration.md](configuration.md#scheduledruns).
