description: Run a bounded supervisor-mediated council of advisors and write a decision memo
argument-hint: "<question> [--advisors name,name] [--max-passes 2|3] [--scope ...] [--non-goals ...]"
---

Run a bounded, supervisor-mediated council on this question. You, the parent
session, are the supervisor. You select the roster, curate cross-advisor packets,
decide which feedback is valid, and write the final memo. Advisors do not talk
directly or see peer transcripts by default. This is not free-form agent chat.

Before you orchestrate, load the council protocol with
`subagent({ action: "guide", topic: "council" })`. The
guide returns the packaged council-mode skill and the references it asks you to
read, so it also works when Pi runs with `--no-skills`.

Parse the invocation yourself. The flags below are conventions, not runtime
options. Record a brief with the question, scope, non-goals, evidence targets,
roster, known advisor context modes, and pass cap. Default `--max-passes` to 2.
Clamp it to 2 or 3. If the question is trivial or settled, answer directly instead
of convening a council.

## Roster

- If `--advisors` is given, use exactly those agent names. Fail clearly on an
  unknown agent. Do not require or invent per-advisor role labels.
- Otherwise inspect the advertised agent catalog with `subagent({ action: "guide", topic: "agents" })`, then prefer 2–3
  executable names that start with `council-`.
- If fewer than two profiles are available, fill the roster with `oracle`, then
  `reviewer`, until it has two advisors. Launch fallback `oracle` as a normal
  single child (`{ agent, task }`); launches are always fresh context.
  Note the fallback in the memo.
- Use the normal single-oracle loop only when a requested roster or unavailable
  builtins leaves fewer than two advisors. Label the memo as degraded mode.

Profiles provide the model, tools, context, and advisor stance. The council
question and scope provide the decision frame. If the user wants a specific lens,
they should put it in the question, scope, or profile definition. Keep the roster
at 2–3 and never exceed 4.

Package advisors such as Surf's `gpt-pro` are valid only when the package Pi
extension is installed and its external-job provider is registered. For Surf,
that means the `surf-cli` Pi extension has loaded and `surf-oracle` appears in
`subagent({ action: "guide", topic: "agents" })` or the advisor is explicitly requested in
`--advisors` after that install. Treat them as external-runner advisors: launch one normal single child
(`{ agent, task }`) for attached council results, include any needed evidence
in the prompt, and use the fresh fallback cross-exam
path if the run is not resumable.

## Run the protocol

Use the canonical workflow, structured advisor contracts, aggregate pass receipts,
and memo requirements from the council guide. Keep the parent as the
only synthesizer and decision maker. Do not introduce a chair advisor, peer chat,
or transcript sharing.

Use its required boundary checkpoints, yield for each async workflow without
polling, and write its required final memo.
